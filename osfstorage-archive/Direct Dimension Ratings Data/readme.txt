The file "dim_ratingsX_Y.txt" provides dimension ratings from participant X in condition Y. 
Participants in condition 1 provided ratings on lightness, grain size, and roughness.
Participants in condition 2 provided ratings on shininess, organization, and chromaticity.
Participants 7, 20, 24, and 26 were excluded from the reported analyses for having low correlations with the other participants' judgments.
Each file contains 360 rows. Each row corresponds to one trial of the experiment. 

Column 1 = dimension (1. lightness/darkness 2. grain size 4. roughness 5. shininess 8. organization 11. chromaticity)
Column 2 = subject id
Column 3 = rock number
Column 4 = subtype number
Column 5 = token number
Column 6 = rating
